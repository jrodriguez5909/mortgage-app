# Mortgage Payment Calculator in the Netherlands
This project is a Streamlit app that calculates the monthly mortgage payment for a house in the Netherlands. The app takes the following inputs:

1. House price
2. Down payment
3. Annual interest rate
4. Loan term
5. Tax deduction
6. Mortgage type

The app then calculates the monthly mortgage payment, as well as the total amount paid over the life of the loan. The app also generates a stacked area chart that shows the monthly principal and interest payments over time.

## How to use the app
To use the app, simply enter the required inputs and click the "Calculate" button. The app will then display the monthly mortgage payment and the stacked area chart.
